		<h2>Kaizo600J Rules</h2>
		<p>First, we establish the "600" variant:
	
		<h3>The "600" Gen 6 Variant</h3>
		<p>The "600" variant changes the legal Pokemon rule for the challenge by allowing legends of 580 and 600 BST to be picked freely, as well as allowing legends to spawn in the wild.</p>
		<p><i>All Pokemon with 600 or less BST are allowed, including legendaries, mythicals, and pseudo-legendaries (as well as 600+ BST non-legendary mons in Standard/Ultimate).  Strong legendary Pokemon (> 600 BST) will have experience curves set to Slow; all other Pokemon will be set to Medium Slow.  Legendary Pokemon should be set to be allowed in the wild.</i></p>

		<h3>Kaizo600J Ruleset Changes</h3>
		<p>The following rules take the place of certain Kaizo rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Held items are allowed, except those banned in Ultimate.</li>
			<li>Healing moves WHICH DO DAMAGE are allowed, but at a limit of one per mon.</li>
			<li>You are allowed to catch and NOT pivot, however you are still limited to one catch per route.</li>
