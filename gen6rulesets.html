		<h1>Gen 6 (XY/ORAS) Ironmon Rulesets</h1>
		<p>The generation 6 Ironmon rulesets have a number of big changes compared to early generation Ironmons. This webpage documents them in an organized manner.</p>
		<p>Before delving into the ruleset changes, make sure that you are familiar with the rules for your <a href="https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1">Ironmon variant</a>.</p>
		<hr />
		<h3>Setup</h3>
		<p>When it comes to running Gen 6 games, the vast majority of runners use Citra for their emulator. It is generally stable and works well. A few notes about it, though:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Citra is rather graphically intensive and requires a solid GPU. Integrated GPUs on lower-end laptops will struggle mightily with Citra. There are no real options on this front.</li>
			<li>Citra does allow for save stating, which many runners do use as safety saves. If you want to do this, turn off automatic updating of Citra and control its version carefully. Version updates have been known to change their save state routines, which will often mean that save states from previous versions will not work. Many runners have effectively lost long-game save states. Update Citra between runs. Additionally, use the regular save feature for important runs.</li>
			<li>A hard save is useful before choosing your starter to speed up the introductory portions. In XY, save when you enter the plaza, but before getting pulled into the main conversation. In ORAS, save when ???</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is a tracker for Gen 6 and 7 games. It is updated semi-frequently. If you are interested in helping develop it further, mention it in the Discord.</p>
		<hr />
		<h3>Rule Changes and Clarifications for all Gen 6 runs</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Berry trees are legal in Gen 6 runs. You are allowed to grab one berry from each tree you run across in the game.</li>
			<li>Sky Battles in XY will still require a Pokemon is Flying type or has the Levitate ability. There are not a lot of these battles. Be careful going near these trainers if you are eligible and do not want to do them.</li>
			<li>After gaining the XP Share item, make sure that it is turned off, especially in Standard and Ultimate!</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Version and Variant Rule Changes</h3>
		<p>There is a current proposed ruleset that most of the community is currently playing. I have included both the current official ruleset changes and the proposed ruleset changes. <span style="color:red;">[NOTE: These are additions/clarifications on the base ruleset, not the complete rulesets!]</span></p>
