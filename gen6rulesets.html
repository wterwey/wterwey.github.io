		<h1>Gen 6 (XY/ORAS) Ironmon Rulesets</h1>
		<p>The generation 6 Ironmon rulesets have a number of big changes compared to early generation Ironmons. This webpage documents them in an organized manner.</p>
		<p>Before delving into the ruleset changes, make sure that you are familiar with the rules for your <a href="https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1">Ironmon variant</a>.</p>

		<h3>Setup</h3>
		<p>When it comes to running Gen 6 games, the vast majority of runners use Citra for their emulator. It is generally stable and works well. A few notes about it, though:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Citra is no longer being worked on as a result of Nintendo lawsuits on a related Switch emulation project.  However, the Citra codebase still exists out there. For more information, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/UTDZac/1db6bbadb9457802d848c4c592d069fd">XY Setup guide</a> for links to the emulators.</li>
			<li>Citra is rather graphically intensive and requires a solid GPU. Integrated GPUs on lower-end laptops will struggle mightily with Citra. There are no real options on this front.</li>
			<li>Citra does allow for save stating, which many runners do use as safety saves. If you want to do this, turn off automatic updating of Citra and control its version carefully. Version updates have been known to change their save state routines, which will often mean that save states from previous versions will not work. Many runners have effectively lost long-game save states. Update Citra between runs. Additionally, use the regular save feature for important runs.</li>
			<li>A hard save is useful before choosing your starter to speed up the introductory portions. In XY, save when you enter the plaza, but before getting pulled into the main conversation. In ORAS, save right before entering the bag (similar to Emerald).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is a tracker for Gen 6 and 7 games. It is updated semi-frequently. If you are interested in helping develop it further, mention it in the Discord.</p>

		<h3>Rule Changes and Clarifications for all Gen 6 runs</h3>
		<p>Current rulesets are available at: <a href="https://gist.github.com/UTDZac/a147c497424dfbd537d8c4b0c22b5621#x--y">UTDZac's rule site</a>.  Please refere to there for up-to-date rulesets.</p>
	
		<h3>The "600" Gen 6 Variant</h3>
		<p>Currently, the community is testing a variant of the ruleset which helps to address the significant increase in BSTs through the game. This variant is referred to as the "600" variant and can be applied to any Gen 6 Ironmon. It is designated by adding "600" to the end of the Ironmon challenge you are completing (i.e. "Kaizo 600", "Survival 600").</p>
		<p>The "600" variant changes the legal Pokemon rule for the challenge by allowing legends of 580 and 600 BST to be picked freely, as well as allowing legends to spawn in the wild.</p>
		<p><i>All Pokemon with 600 or less BST are allowed, including legendaries, mythicals, and pseudo-legendaries, as well as 600+ BST non-legendary mons.  Strong legendary Pokemon (> 600 BST) will have experience curves set to Slow; all other Pokemon will be set to Fluctuating.  Legendary Pokemon should be set to be allowed in the wild.</i></p>

		<h3>Doubles</h3>
		<p>This is a developing set of rules for Doubles in Gen 6. These will be updated as needed. <a href="https://gist.github.com/UTDZac/a147c497424dfbd537d8c4b0c22b5621#kaizo-doubles-rules">Basic Doubles rules</a> are explained. What we feature here are proposed changes for a variety of Doubles challenges:</p>
		<table width="50%" border="1px,black" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
			<tr>
				<td>XY Ultimate Doubles<br /><i>(updated: 1/14/24)</i></td>
				<td>XY Kaizo Doubles<br /><i>(updated: 1/14/24)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>Working from the ruleset above:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Additional Pokemon for bosses should be set to +2 and regular trainers should be set to +1. Important trainers remain +1.</li>
						<li>EXP curve should remain as Fluctuating.</li>
						<li>The one kill per route rule is rescinded. [NOTE: There is enough XP given by trainers and the rules.]</li>
						<li>Duplicate items between team Pokemon are not allowed.</li>
						<li>Permadeath still exists; however the run may continue if you still have two battle-eligible Pokemon to run. The run ends when you do not have two battle-eligible Pokemon. [NOTE: HM friends are NOT battle-eligible.]</li>
					</ul>
