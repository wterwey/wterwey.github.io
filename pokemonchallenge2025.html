		<h1>2025 Pokemon Challenge - Jellisky</h1>
		<p>Below are the basic information for the 2025 Pokemon challenge for Jellisky.  We will be playing through 15 different Pokemon games through 2025 on the weekends. Choices are made randomly; specific games are marked as they are completed!</p>
		<p>If I feel comfortable enough with a game, I will be doing a basic Nuzlocke challenge on it... if I do not feel comfortable with a game, it will be run vanilla.</p>
		<p>Since 2025 is the year of Eevee, any game which has access to Eevee will prioritize catching and using one throughout the game. Let's Go Eevee!</p>
		<p>Further explanations and FAQs will be noted in coming weeks!</p>

		<h3>Pokemon Let's Go Eevee easier-Nuzlocke rules</h3>
		<p>We will start with the following ruleset: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/a1gu9j/pokemon_lets_go_nuzlocke_rule_set/">LGE/P Nuzlocke ruleset</a></p>
		<p>We will modify it in the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If first Pokemon on route flees, can catch another, until one is caught on each route.</li>
			<li>Whiteout/blackout is not restart, but re-battle - can change team as needed. (We don't have time for all that.)</li>
			<li>Pokeball purchases can be done only if totally run out.</li>
			<li>Rulesets may change as needed, since we're not going super-strict on this, folks.  I'm doing this to make it a little more challenging on me, but not so I have to replay the game more than once.  If that bothers you, you're free to find other entertainment elsewhere.</li>
		</ul>
